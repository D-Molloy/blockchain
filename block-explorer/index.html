					<p>Blockchain technology is the future of digital record keeping.  But how, specifically, does a blockchain work?  What makes it so secure?  How might one build a blockchain in JavaScript? Block-Explorer is here to answer those questions for you!</p>
					<p>Block-Explorer will let you build a blockchain network, create transactions, mine new blocks, check the blockchain's integrity, as well as view and search the blockchain.  Please reference the source code (ie. blockchain.js (the data structure) and networkNode.js (the node server)) as you go through the tabs (above) to get an even deeper understanding of how the blockchain works.</p>

		<!-- CONNECT -->

		<div id="connect" class="col s12">
			<h3>Connect Nodes to the Network</h3>
			<p class="tab_descrip">One of the pillars of blockchain technology is that it (the blockchain) is hosted on a
				<b>
					<em>decentralized</em>
				</b>
				and
				<b>
					<em>distributed</em>
				</b> network of nodes. When you start the first node server in the network, a
				<kbd>Genesis block</kbd> is created signifying the start of the chain. Each node keeps a record of the current blockchain,
				and the nodes communicate with each other to ensure the integrity of the data on the other nodes. Now we need to create
				the network that will host our blockchain.</p>
			<p class="tab_descrip">
				After entering a node URL and clicking the [Add Node] button, a POST request is made to this nodes
				<kbd>/register-and-broadcast-node</kbd> endpoint and the new node is added to this servers blockchain
				<kbd>networkNodes</kbd> property (as long as it doesn't exist). Then a POST request is made to every network node's
				<kbd>/register-node</kbd> route to add/register the new network node url to that nodes networkNodes array. Once the rest of
				the network has been updated with the new node URL, a final POST request is made to the new node's
				<kbd>/register-nodes-bulk</kbd> route so that the new node is aware of all the other nodes URLs.
			</p>
			<p class="tab_descrip">In order to connect your node to another node, be sure that you have started another node server by entering
				<kbd>npm run node_[SERVER NUMBER]</kbd> (node_1 through node_5 are setup by default) in a new terminal. Once that is running,
				enter the server address below and click [Add Node]. Once you're done adding nodes, it's time to move to the `2 - TRANSACT`
				tab to make some transactions!</p>

		<div id="transact" class="col s12">
			<h3>Create a Transaction</h3>
			<p class="tab_descrip">The blockchain that we're working with is built to store records of 'monetary' transactions, similar to how the Bitcoin Blockchain operates. Transactions are simply records of how much (in our case) a sender sends to a recipient, though it could be used to store any sort of record.</p>
			<p class="tab_descrip">Once you fill in the form below and click [Make Transaction] button, this transaction is given a Universally Unique Identifier
				(UUID) and added to your node's
				<kbd>pendingTransactions</kbd> array. Then, your node will iterate over its
				<kbd>networkNodes</kbd> array and make POST requests to each node's
				<kbd>/transaction</kbd> end point which adds the transaction to that node's
				<kbd>pendingTransactions</kbd> array ensuring data stays up-to-date across the network.</p>
			<p class="tab_descrip">Feel free to add multiple transactions. The new transactions will remain a pending transaction until a new block is mined
				in `3 - MINE` at which point it will be cemented as part of the blockchain.</p>

		<!-- MINE -->
		<div id="mine" class="col s12">
			<h3>Mine a new Block</h3>
			<p class="tab_descrip">In order to permanently add all of the pending transactions to our Blockchain ledger, we need to mine a new block, adding
				a new link to blockchain. </p>
			<p class="tab_descrip">When you click on the [Mine a New Block] button, a GET request is made to your node's
				<kbd>/mine</kbd> route. Inside that route, the last block in the chain and its hash are noted, and the data for the new block
				is setup (pendingTransactions are added as the new blocks transactions and a block ID is added).</p>
			<p class="tab_descrip">The hash of the current last block and the new block data are used in to create the
				<kbd>Proof of Work (PoW)</kbd>. The
				<kbd>Proof of Work</kbd> is the workhorse of the blockchain and the reason blockchain technology is so secure. </p>
			<p class="tab_descrip">The
				<kbd>Proof of Work</kbd> is executed thousands of times (can be anywhere from 10k-100k times) in search of the correct
				<kbd>nonce</kbd>, making adding fraudulent data to the chain next to impossible. First, the nonce is declared and assigned
				a value of `0`. The nonce counts how many time the data needs to be hashed before our defined criteria is met. The block
				is hashed for the first time using the previous block's hash, the new block data and the nonce. Next, a while loop is
				used to continually increment the nonce and rehash the new block's data until the hash starts with four zeroes. Once
				the hash starts with four zeroes, the correct nonce is returned.</p>
			<p class="tab_descrip">Now that the correct nonce is known, it is used along with the previous block's hash and the new block data in order to
				get the new block's hash. All of this data (as a string) is hashed using a SHA-256 hash algorithm. The new block hash
				serves as an identifier for the new block, but also contains all the data used to create the hash.</p>
			<p class="tab_descrip">The nonce, new block hash, and the hash of the current last block are all used to create the new block. The new block
				is an object and given the following properties: an index (its location in the change), timestamp, list of transactions
				(these were the pending transactions), the nonce, the new hash for this block, and the hash of the previous block (chaining
				the new block to the rest of the chain). Your nodes list of pending transactions is then cleared and the new block is
				added to your nodes chain array.</p>
			<p class="tab_descrip">Now that the new block has been added to the chain on your node, the rest of the network nodes need to be updated. POST
				requests are made to each node's
				<kbd>/receive-new-block</kbd> route. Here, the data in the new block is compared to the node's last block of the chain. If
				the new block has the correct previous block hash AND the correct index, then the new block will be added to that node's
				chain and the list of pending transactions will be cleared. If either the previous block hash or the index are wrong,
				the new block will be rejected.</p>
			<p class="tab_descrip">Finally, as is the case in 'real' blockchains, when a node mines a new block, it receives payment for the effort of mining
				a new block. This 'tip' is broadcasted to your node's POST
				<kbd>/transaction/broadcast</kbd> route where it is added to your block's pending transactions array, and the tip transaction
				is also broadcast to the rest of the network via a POST request to each node's
				<kbd>/transaction</kbd> endpoint.</p>

			<h3>View the Entire Blockchain</h3>

		<!-- CONSENSUS -->
		<div id="consensus" class="col s12">
			<h3>Check Blockchain Validity</h3>
			<p class="tab_descrip">The nodes in the blockchain network need a way of discerning whether or not the data in their copy of the blockchain is
				valid. This is accomplished using what is referred to as a
				<kbd>Consensus Algorithm</kbd>. This blockchain's Consensus Algorithm utitlizes the
				<kbd>Longest Chain Rule</kbd>, which means that one node's copy of the blockchain is compared to every other node's copy of
				the blockchain. If the other node's copy of the chain is longer than the node that made the initial request, then the
				longer chain replaces the node's chain and its pending transactions are replaced with those of the longest chain. If
				there is no new longest chain (meaning your node is has the longest chain) OR if there is a new longest chain and that
				chain is not valid, then the node's current chain will not be replaced. If there is a new longest chain AND the chain
				is valid, then the current node's chain will be updated and replaced with the new chain longest. The blockchain is determined
				to be valid by calling the
				<kbd>chainIsValid</kbd> method on the blockchain data structure. This method starts of by comparing the previousBlockHash
				property of the current block to the previous block's hash making sure that they match down the chain. Then, the current
				block is rehashed to ensure that it is valid. Finally, the properties of the Genesis Block are checked to ensure they
				have the correct values. If all of these checks pass, then the chain is deemed valid and is note replaced</p>
			<p class="tab_descrip">By clicking the [Check Chain Validity] button below, a GET request is made to
				<kbd>/consensus</kbd> checking the validity of this node's chain.</p>
